It's that time of year again, where I attempt to rank and list my favourite new albums of the year. I tend to have a
bit of a tough time with these, cause I generally hate rating things beyond a 'yes / meh / no' scale. Oh well. the
usual warnings apply; I'm not a music reviewer, this is all purely subjective, I might use naughty words, etc.
Without further ado, my Favourite Albums of 2022:

---
![Happy Now](happy-now.jpg)
## #10 Thick, _Happy Now_
{{< lead >}}19 August - Indie Rock, Pop Punk{{</ lead >}}

My first introduction to this Brooklyn-based trio was the opening for Dream Wife in NYC as the latter toured in support
of their first album. I bought their two home-burned EPs at that show, and I'm excitied to say that their second
full-length album carries on what first caught my interest: garage-rock riffs, relatable punk-rock lyrics, and just a
damn good time.

![Laurel Hell](laurel-hell.jpg)
## #9 - Mitski, _Laurel Hell_
{{< lead >}}04 February - Synthpop, Art Pop{{</ lead >}}

I have to be honest: I'm a little late to the party on Mitski. She was one of those artists that I kept hearing about
and intending to listen to, but never got around to it. The release of the first single "Working for the Knife"
late last year is what finally inspired me to put her music on, and it's been a staple for me ever since. _Laurel Hell_
is no execption, a continued refinement of Mitski's songwriting prowess as she branches into more synth-heavy production
than her previous folk and indie rock influences.

## #8 - Shaam Larein, _Sticka en kniv i världen_
{{< lead >}}09 December - Gothic Rock, Doom Metal{{</ lead >}}

Mood. So much Mood. The follow up to Shaam Larein's 2020 debut _Sculpture_ hits all the right notes, succeeding in
building a dark and spooky atmosphere that grabs on and does not let go.

## #7 - Messa, _Close_
{{< lead >}}11 March - Doom Metal, Stoner Rock{{</ lead >}}

---
![The Shark in Your Water](the-shark-in-your-water.jpg)
## #6 - Flower Face, _The Shark in Your Water_
{{< lead >}}27 May - Indie Pop, Dream Pop{{</ lead >}}

![Where Myth Becomes Memory](where-myth-becomes-memory.jpg)
## #2 - Rolo Tomassi, _Where Myth Becomes Memory_
{{< lead >}}04 February - Post-metal, Post-hardcore{{</ lead >}}

Following up on 2019's _Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It_, Rolo Tomassi

![Shunka Ryugen](shunka-ryugen.jpg)
## #1 - Haru Nemuri, _Shunka Ryugen_ 
{{< lead >}}22 April - J-rock, Art Pop{{</ lead >}}

This one kinda came out of nowhere. I've never really gotten into J-pop/rock/etc., for no reason other than I haven't
taken the time to listen to it. Nemuri's first album, 2018's _Haru to Shura_, popped up in my recommendations on 
Spotify in early April, so I gave it a listen and enjoyed it. A few weeks later when _Shunka Ryugen_ showed up in my
new releases, I had all but forgotten about the first album and was blown away.

With songs ranging from hip-hop to post-hardcore, Nemuri showcases her many talents across the album, allowing herself
the freedom to experiment with different sounds and genres. Although not necessarily as 'cohesive' as her first effort,
the variety on display never left me bored.
