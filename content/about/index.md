### About Me

{{< lead >}}More than you'd ever want to know{{</ lead >}}

Hi! I'm Eir, or Erik. I'm a developer and software engineer currently located in Upstate New York. I hold a B.S. in
Computer Science from [RIT](https://rit.edu), and have been programming casually and professionally for over a decade.
Historically, my main languages have been PHP and Python with some JS when necessary, but I've been experimenting on
the side more recently, exploring other popular languages like Go, Lua, and Rust.

I'm primarily a Linux user, with it acting as my main OS on all my machines. [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and
[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) are my go-to distros, though I set up the same [i3](https://i3wm.org/) and
[fish](https://fishshell.com/) environment on everything for consistency. [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is my editor of
choice, unless I need a fully-featured IDE, in which case I'll generally reach for a 
[JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) tool.

I'm an avid [curler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling), having grown up near the Canadian border watching the 
sport on OTA channels out of Kingston. My other hobbies include gaming, books and movies (primarily SFF), music, and
tinkering with various computers and electronics. I'm planning to include lists of [books](/books) and movies that I
like on here, and music I listen to can already be found at [last.fm](https://last.fm/user/eirrw).

### About the Site

{{< lead >}}What is it good for?{{</ lead >}}

Currently my intentions for the site are _unclear_, but there's a few things I'm interested in
building. Ideas include occasional blogs about tech + media (that I used to put on twitter {{< icon "skull-crossbones"
>}}), migrating the text files and spreadsheets that I use to track movies I watch and books I read, and just a general
playground for fun things.

I still have to decide how professional I want to keep the site; if I use it as a personal site that potential (or
current) employers can see, the content may change. "Keeping it real" is a goal though, particularly with the former
twitter blogs (or rants, really). I didn't hold a lot back.
