{{< lead >}}The personal website of a single developer{{</ lead >}}

Welcome to __eirrw.dev__. Currently my intentions for the site are _unclear_, but there's a few things I'm interested in
building. Ideas include occasional blogs about tech + media (that I used to put on twitter {{< icon "skull-crossbones"
>}}), migrating the text files and spreadsheets that I use to track movies I watch and books I read, and just a general
playground for fun things.

I still have to decide how professional I want to keep the site; if I use it as a personal site that potential (or
current) employers can see, the content may change. "Keeping it real" is a goal though, particularly with the former
twitter blogs (or rants, really). I didn't hold a lot back.

Honestly, this whole front-page text should probably have been its own blog post - it's a lot to read through now that
I'm looking at it. Maybe I'll migrate it if I decide on something better to put here :shrug:.
